AS In parameter INOUT_NEXT_LIFNR, vendor number &V1& was transferred as    
   the starting point. This vendor number, however, is not contained in    
   table INOUT_LIFNR_TAB. Normally, this inconsistency should not occur if 
   the values are transferred to INOUT_NEXT_LIFNR and INOUT_LIFNR_TAB in   
   subsequent calls as they were returned in previous calls of the         
   function module.

AS Find out how an incorrect vendor number was saved in parameter          
   INOUT_NEXT_LIFNR. During the first call, the function module was        
   possibly called without using the initial parameter INOUT_NEXT_LIFNR    
   within a sequence of blocked calls.
