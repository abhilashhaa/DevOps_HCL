AS In parameter INOUT_NEXT_KUNNR, customer number &V1& was transferred as  
   the starting point. This customer number, however, is not contained in  
   table INOUT_KUNNR_TAB. This inconsistency should normally not occur if  
   the values are transferred to INOUT_NEXT_KUNNR and INOUT_KUNNR_TAB in   
   subsequent calls as they were returned in previous calls of the         
   function module.

AS Find out how an incorrect customer number was saved in parameter        
   INOUT_NEXT_KUNNR. During the first call, the function module was        
   possibly called without using the initial parameter INOUT_NEXT_KUNNR    
   within a sequence of blocked calls.
