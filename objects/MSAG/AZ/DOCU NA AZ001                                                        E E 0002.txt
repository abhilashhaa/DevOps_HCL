AS In parameter INOUT_NEXT_MATNR, material number &V1& was transferred as  
   the starting point. This material number, however, is not contained in  
   table INOUT_MATNR_TAB. Normally, this inconsistency should not occur if 
   the values are transferred to INOUT_NEXT_MATNR and INOUT_MATNR_TAB in   
   subsequent calls as they were returned in previous calls of the         
   function module.

AS Find out how an incorrect material number was saved in parameter        
   INOUT_NEXT_MATNR. During the first call, the function module was        
   possibly called without using the initial parameter INOUT_NEXT_MATNR    
   within a sequence of blocked calls.
