AS Im parameter INOUT_NEXT_WERKS, plant number &V1& was transferred as the 
   starting point. This plant number, however, is not contained in table   
   INOUT_WERKS_TAB. Normally, this inconsistency should not occur if the   
   values are transferred to INOUT_NEXT_WERKS and INOUT_WERKS_TAB in       
   subsequent calls as they were returned in previous calls of the         
   function module.

AS Find out how an incorrect plant number was saved in parameter           
   INOUT_NEXT_WERKS. During the first call, the function module was

   a sequence of blocked calls.
