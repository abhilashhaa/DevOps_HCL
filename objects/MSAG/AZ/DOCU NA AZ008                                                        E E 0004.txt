AS Data extractors consist of two parts:                                   
B1 A key extractor for determining the key values of the header table.     
B1 A data extractor that returns the data of all supported tables          
   beginning with the key values.                                          
AS Both extractors consist of two modules (an initialization module and a  
   module for determining the next data). An initialization module was not 
   called in your application.
